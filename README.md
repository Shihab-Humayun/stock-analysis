# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on the stock data sheet by using VBA macros. We would like to know the total daily volume and the return of each stock by making the user input a specific year. Although Steve admired the previous VBA script, which was able to display the stock analysis for a dozen of stocks, we would like to create a more efficient script. If there thousands of stocks needed to be analyzed, having an improved VBA script will be beneficial and take less time to calculate the data.
